Growing quality black pepper requires healthy soil, yet many farmers are unaware of their 
soil's true state.  In remote locations, traditional manual soil testing is frequently 
unavailable, expensive, and sluggish.  As a result, farmers may apply unnecessary 
fertilizers or make decisions based on guesswork or experience.  This can reduce crop 
yield, lower harvest quality, and increase farming costs.  Beginner-level farmers cannot 
afford repeated laboratory tests, making informed soil management difficult.  
The goal of this research is to integrate artificial intelligence and Internet of Things 
sensors to create a smart soil health monitoring system. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium 
(NPK), pH, moisture, and temperature are among the important soil characteristics that 
the system measures. Before planting and throughout the black pepper's growth cycle, 
farmers can assess the condition of the soil. 
The technology determines a soil health score prior to planting and, in the event that any 
nutrient levels are low, suggests fertiliser treatment. Following seeding, it keeps an eye 
on the condition of the soil and looks for signs of nutrient depletion brought on by plant 
growth. The method recommends the type and quantity of fertiliser to restore ideal soil 
conditions if soil health declines. Farmers can monitor changes in soil health over time 
because all readings are recorded.  
By providing farmers with real-time, useful advice, this method helps them cut down on 
wasteful spending, enhance soil management, and produce healthier black pepper plants. 
Even in places without conventional soil testing facilities, the project enables farmers to 
make well-informed decisions, maximise crop production and quality, and optimise 
fertiliser consumption by fusing IoT-based soil sensing with AI-driven 
recommendations.
